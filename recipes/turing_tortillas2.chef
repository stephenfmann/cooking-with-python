Turings Tortillas.

This is a universal turing machine in Chef. What? Yeah, really. It is. Just make sure you deliver a large enough tape.
1st & 2nd mixing bowl = tape
3 & 4 = writebit
5 & 6 = directionbit (1 = R, 0 = L)
7 & 8 = statebit (0 = endstate)
9: store tapelength
10: store statecount
11: store currentstate/state
12: store tape position
State Leesbit Schrijfbit Richting(L=0, R=1) State(0=eindstate)
