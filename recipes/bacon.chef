Bubbled and Baked Bacon.

A tasty bacon recipe, leaving it all baked and bubbled with a little decorative flag skewer on top.
All arranged in the right order, of course. It's a pity for whoever gets to do the dishes, though; the recipe uses 4 bowls, one of which exclusively for a little wooden flag.
