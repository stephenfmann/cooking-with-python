Arbitrarily Delicious Cherry Pie.

Calculates the value of pie to an arbitrarily delicious degree of accuracy. You start with 1, 2 or 3 cherries; the more you add, the more deliciously accurate the pie will be. For every four cherries you use, your pie will gain about three more delicious decimal digits - that is, it will be approximately one thousand times more delicious.
